                        The Systems Intelligence &amp; Data Analytics office manages the course evaluation system

                        Student feedback is vital to the success of UNO. Results of evaluations are used by faculty to
                        make changes to course content and delivery. University administrators use the evaluation
                        results to make personnel decisions. Every student is expected and encouraged to provide
                        feedback
                        for all the courses they are enrolled in.

                                        students once the semester evaluation period begins. Canvas notifications with
                                        direct links are also used to remind students to complete their course
                                        evaluations.

                                        Through Canvas, faculty have access to their individual response rate
                                        monitors once the evaluation period begins. Faculty are not able to identify
                                        a student's evaluation response or whether a student has completed an evaluation
                                        or not. Evaluation summary results are available a week after final grades
                                        are submitted. These results contain a summary of all student responses
                                        with no student identifying information. Email notifications are sent out to
                                        faculty once evaluation results are available for viewing.
